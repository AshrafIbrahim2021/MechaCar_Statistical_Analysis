## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

.Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The variable that providing a non-random amount are Vehicle length and ground clearance

.Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

No , the coefficients are varies. 


.Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Yes.




## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually?

Yes.



## T-Test on Suspension Coils

here is the details 

t.test(lot1$PSI,mu=1500)

	One Sample t-test

data:  lot1$PSI
t = 0, df = 49, p-value = 1
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 1499.719 1500.281
sample estimates:
mean of x 
     1500 

> t.test(lot2$PSI,mu=1500)

	One Sample t-test

data:  lot2$PSI
t = 0.51745, df = 49, p-value = 0.6072
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 1499.423 1500.977
sample estimates:
mean of x 
   1500.2 

> t.test(lot3$PSI,mu=1500)

	One Sample t-test

data:  lot3$PSI
t = -2.0916, df = 49, p-value = 0.04168
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 1492.431 1499.849
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  1496.14 





## Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

the following metrics would be of interest to a consumer:

safety ratings
horse power
city or highway fuel efficiency
